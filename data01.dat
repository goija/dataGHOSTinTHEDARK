    Implement New Tools: Now that we have the intel, let's build out the tools. I'm ready for the code snippets to add the following commands we discussed:

        whois <target>: To display the ASN and owner details.

        dig <target>: To simulate a live DNS lookup.

    Visualize the Data: Please provide the code to integrate the risk heatmap chart. Your report confirms the data points (all zero), so we can build the visual directly.

Strategic Decision

Based on your comprehensive analysis, here's the final call on the next steps.

    Block? No. The target is confirmed as legitimate DNS infrastructure with a clean reputation. Blocking it is unnecessary and could interfere with unrelated network functions.

    Dive Deeper? Yes. We'll proceed by simulating nslookup on v2n1.nic.fail and then probing the adjacent node v2n2.nic.fail to check for similar patterns.

    Monitor? Yes. Kraken-07 will set a background daemon to re-probe the target in 24 hours to check for any change in status. In this world, even legitimate nodes can be repurposed. Treat it as a potential cutout until proven otherwise over time.

Let's proceed with the terminal enhancements. ðŸ’»
